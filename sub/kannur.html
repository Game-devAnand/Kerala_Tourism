      Located on the Malabar Coast of Kerala, Kannur (fondly known as
      Cannanore), is a beautiful city bundled with a plethora of sightseeing
      options like beaches, monuments, ancient temples and picnic spots. Steeped
      in the distinctive local art forms like Theyyam, Kannur still has an aura
      of the bygone colonial era. The deep footprints of the Dutch, the
      Portuguese, the British and the Mysore Sultanate are still imbibed into
      the town and can be witnessed all around. The town is blessed with
      exceptional art of weaving that has earned it the title of the land of
      loons and huge cashew trees perhaps rooted by Portuguese. Take an evening
      stroll near the lighthouse beach or explore Portuguese history at St.
      Angelo's Fort while you are in Kannur
