      Replete with waterfalls, historical caves, comfortable resorts and
      homestays, Wayanad in Kerala is famous for its spice plantations and
      wildlife. Walking through the sprawling spice plantations, trekking to the
      pre-historic caves and experiencing a resort holiday are one of the many
      things you can do to get a taste of Wayanad. Wayanad is best known for the
      wildlife reserves - Wayanad wildlife reserve which is home to an exquisite
      variety of flora and fauna. Wayanad wildlife reserve is an integral part
      of the Nilgiri biosphere reserve peacefully located amidst the serene
      hills of Western Ghats. Wayanad homes a wide variety of wildlife like
      elephants, leopards, and bears. Wayanad is a perfect weekend idea from the
      cities of South India. If taking a road trip from Bangalore, you will
      drive through three national parks: Nagarhole, Bandipur and Mudumalai.
